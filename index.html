            <p>If you've got lots of money and you're a bit daft, 
                NFTs are a great way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic value or even exist. 
                Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT bandwagon and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images. 
                Our advice: spend the weekend crafting an NFT and by this time next week,you'll be a millionaire.
